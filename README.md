# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 :
 For python maths program first we want import numpy
### Step 2: 
Then a variable in that variable we want to give np.array following that given question
### Step 3: 
Then assume another variable in that variable give np.linalg.inv to find the inverse of the matrix
### Step 4: 
Then print the inverse of the matrix
## Program:
import numpy as np
A=np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
B=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(B)
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
